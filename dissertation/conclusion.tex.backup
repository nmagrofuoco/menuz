\chapter{Conclusion}
Conceiving, designing and testing new menu organizations was a long and though 
task. First, it required to understand and summarize previous researches. 
It was an essential step to extract the currently available knowledge about 
menu usability. Then, it was critical to formulate an initial set of 
hypotheses in order to guide the development of the experimental method. 
Based on these assumptions, an Android application was implemented to conduct 
the experiment and results were extracted from it. After an in-depth analysis 
of these results, we were finally able to confirm, reverse and update our 
hypotheses.\newline

The experimental method set up during the study helped us to confirm many 
assumptions. First, we observed that all new menu organizations were beneficial 
to reduce the average error rate, except for the split menu which provided the 
same error rate than the traditional menu. Then, we proved that the responsive 
and the 4 mixed-initiative menus helped users to reduce their average selection 
time and enhance their productivity. Moreover, users showed a higher preference 
rate for the responsive and the traditional menus. Finally, we proved that 
guidance informations could help users to understand the overal operation of a 
menu organization.\newline

In conclusion, the split menu organization developed by \textsc{Sears} and 
\textsc{Shneiderman} is not the ideal solution for smartphone resolutions. The 
traditional and responsive menus received the highest user preference. The 
responsive menu also proved to be the most performant one in terms of 
usability. Therefore, the responsive menu designed by Yusuke \textsc{Fukazawa} 
with a specific focus towards small touch screens appears to be the most 
promising menu organization for smartphones. Further experiments should focus 
on this new and novative menu organization.

\section{Further}
Some matters remains unchallenged after our experiment. Further improvements 
and issues remain to be undertaken, improved and fixed to keep enhancing our 
knowledge base about HCI and menu usability. This section aims to enumerate some 
of these matters.

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Large menu}: according to Khalid \textsc{Al-Omar} and Dimitrios 
\textsc{Rigas}, our set of menu items should be considered as a \enquote{small 
menu}. They tested new menu organizations with both a small set of 17 items and 
a larger set of 29 items. During their controlled experiment, they identified 
varying preferences between these menus. Therefore, the responsive menu may not 
be the ideal solution with larger menus.
 \item \textbf{Hot list}: according to \textsc{Sears} and 
\textsc{Shneiderman}, the hot list of a split menu should not exceed 4 items. 
During the experiment, we decided to implement a hot list made of 3 items. The 
split menu organization may be preferred by users with a different length. 
Indeed, implementing a split menu with 4 or less items may be a better solution.
 \item \textbf{Learning effect}: some subjects of the experiment were concerned 
about the learning effect between each session. Indeed, a few ones recognized 
to know the items better after a few evaluation sessions. Therefore, the 
final results may include some kind of bias.
 \item \textbf{Evaluation session}:
 \item \textbf{Keystroke menu}:
 \item \textbf{Log file}:
\end{itemize}
