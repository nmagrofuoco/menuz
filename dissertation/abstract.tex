\chapter*{Abstract}
In 1994, \textsc{Sears} and \textsc{Shneiderman} proposed the changing concept 
of split menu. They have radically influenced the way we have designed menus 
until today. Unfortunately, their guidelines haven't evolved in 20 years and 
the advent of smartphones have led HCI researchers to new and different 
usability issues. Based on their initial study, this master thesis aims to 
conceive, design and test a split menu adapted to smartphone 
resolutions.\newline

Along the way, the approaches from various researchers have influenced our 
experiment and diverse menu organizations have also been designed and tested. 
An experimental method has been conducted combining traditional, split, 
responsive, minimised and mixed-initiative menus. The objective of this method 
was to assess the usability of these new menu organizations on smartphones. 
Usability has been studied along with 3 interesting properties: (1) 
effectiveness, (2) efficiency and (3) user satisfaction.\newline

The experiment proved that split menu may not be the ideal solution for 
smartphones. Another novative menu organization called \enquote{responsive} 
has shown a better usability. This dissertation aims to explain the development 
of the experiment and argue the analysis of its results.
