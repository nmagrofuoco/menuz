\chapter{Introduction}
Since the initial drawings of Charles Babbage and the first modern computer 
built by Konrad Zuse, computer technology has evolved and spread around the 
globe as ever before. Initially dedicated and used by a few IT professionals, 
the advent of personal computing radically changed the game and made everyone a 
potential computer user \cite{hci}. Computer providers faced serious usability 
issues with the initial command dialogs. Some still recognized brands took 
advantage of innovative and creative minds to overcome these problems.\newline

Unfortunately the effectiveness of their solutions has often not been 
scientifically proved. In the early 1980s, some computer scientists showed great 
interest into assessing the usability of the traditionally designed UI's. An 
area of research and practice called \enquote{human-computer interaction} - and 
commonly referred to as \textit{HCI} - started to emerge along with these 
scientists. They focused on studying the information transfer between humans 
and computers. Later they even started to imagine and develop their own UI 
solutions to enhance UX.\newline

Last decade saw the rise of mobile technologies. Minimising computer components 
has always been a common interest for computer manufacturers. Smartphone in the 
hand, tablet in the other. People have become keen of these microtechnologies. 
Unfortunately they raised new issues. Among them, the complexification of UI has 
become an increasing problem for users, especially for novices. We come to a 
point where humans themselves must adapt to the technology and HCI has still a 
long road ahead.

\section{Objectives}
This master thesis was initially focused on the conception, the design and the 
testing of a split menu for smartphone. Starting with the guidelines proposed 
by Sears and Shneiderman \cite{sears} almost 20 years ago, the main objective 
was to formulate a new set of guidelines based on the small size of smartphone 
touching screens. An intense review of the field of study brang us to take into 
account diverse approaches. %TODO usability à definir et dire qu'on cherche à

\section{Structure of the written dissertation}
The written dissertation is organized as follows :

\begin{enumerate}
  \item textbf{State of the Art}: the first chapter is the starting point of 
the study. It provides a deep review of the field of research and presents the 
assumptions over which the entire experiment was built.
  \item \textbf{Methodology}: the second chapter describes the methodology used 
to conceive the experiment. It describes the initial hypotheses, the operation 
of the experimental method which was conducted with participants and finally 
describes the implementation of the application used to conduct the experiment.
\end{enumerate}
