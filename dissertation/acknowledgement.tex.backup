\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

This Master's thesis is the accomplishment of many years of ongoing learning. 
It represents our contribution to this magnificent edifice which is education.\\

We would first like to thank sincerely our thesis advisor Prof. Peter 
\textsc{Van Roy}. His door was always open whenever we ran into an issue or had 
a question about our research or writing. He steered us in the right direction 
from our first meeting until the very last one. Even though he was 
travelling, a \textsc{Skype} conversation was always possible.\\

We would also like to acknowledge both readers Prof. Charles \textsc{Pêcheur} 
and Prof. Sébastien \textsc{Combéfis} who graciously agreed to take part to 
this thesis.\\

Finally, we must express our very profound gratitude to our parents for 
providing us with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout our 
own process of learning, studying, researching, coding and writing this 
thesis. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. Thank 
you.\\
