\chapter{State of the Art}

The state of the art is the starting point of a study. A critical 
review of the research question is always a necessary prerequisite. It allows 
to identify the findings, nuances, authors and remaining issues of an area of 
study. This literature survey is illustrated as a time line (see Figure 
\ref{fig:timeline}) that depicts the evolution of knowledge on the effects 
of menu organization on user experience. It starts with the premises, the 
initial researches that started everything almost 40 years ago. Then it 
describes the advent of split menu - an important change in menu organization - 
and tries to clarify the debate between adaptive and adaptable approaches. It 
also describes an interesting work about responsive menus. Finally it brings a 
final note about the learning outcomes of these previous researches.

\section{Premises}

Back in the early 80’s, a few researchers conducted a first set of experiments 
to better understand the effects of menu organization on user experience and 
user performance. However the scope of analysis was restrained to static and 
dynamic menu organizations only. Most of these studies resulted to be partially 
useful but they set interesting premises for the next ones.\newline
 
According to \textsc{Sears} and \textsc{Shneiderman} \cite{sears}, 
\textsc{Card} \cite{card} was the first 
researcher to show interest in assessing menu usability. In 1982 already, 
\textsc{Card} 
conducted an experiment based on 3 menu organizations : (1) alphabetically 
ordered items, (2) categorically ordered items and (3) randomly ordered items. 
These menus are depicted by Figure \ref{fig:card_menus}. \textsc{Card} proved 
that 
alphabetically ordered menus were the fastest whereas randomly ordered menus 
were the slowest ones. He also assumed that a \textit{meaningful organization} 
- such as 
alphabetical or categorical ordering - could be beneficial for user 
experience.\newline

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \include{tikz/card_menus}
    \label{fig:card_menus}
\end{figure}

In 1987, \textsc{Somberg} \cite{somberg} also investigated the effects of menu 
organization on user performance. He replaced \textsc{Card}’s categorically 
ordered menu 
with a new approach based on probability of selection. A probability was bound 
to each item and was modified at each step of the test, displaying different 
menu organizations throughout the entire study. The alphabetical menu was also 
subject to changes as the first displayed letter was chosen randomly from one 
iteration to another. The randomly, alphabetically and probability ordered 
menus were then considered as dynamic menus. These designs are depicted by 
Figure \ref{fig:somberg_menus} which highlights two potential iterations for 
each dynamic menu. The 4th menu organization proposed by the author was called 
\enquote{positionally constant} and consisted of a static alphabetically 
ordered menu. \textsc{Somberg} proved that keeping the items in \textit{fixed 
locations} was more 
performant than allowing the items to move within the menu. Indeed the 
positionally constant menu was prefered and resulted in better user performance 
than dynamic ones.\newline

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \label{fig:somberg_menus}
\end{figure}

In 1985, \textsc{Greenberg} and \textsc{Witten} \cite{greenberg_witten} 
investigated the benefits 
of organizing a menu based on a-priori set of frequencies and updating these 
frequencies according to user’s selections. \textsc{Mitchell} and 
\textsc{Shneiderman} 
\cite{mitchell_shneiderman} provided the first convincing results about such a 
frequency reordering in 1989. They conducted an experiment in which they 
compared a static menu to an automatically reorganized menu based on frequency. 
At first exposure, users preferred, were faster and made fewer errors with the 
static menu. After practice, \textsc{Mitchell} and \textsc{Shneiderman} proved 
that user 
performance was not a problem anymore with the dynamic menu. However this menu 
organization was still not preferred over the static one. They ended up by 
concluding that automatically updating menu organization to reflect the current 
usage patterns might be useful but could also lead to several problems.

\section{The Advent of Split Menu}

In 1994, \textsc{Sears} and \textsc{Shneiderman} \cite{sears} proposed the 
changing concept of 
\textit{split menu}. Based on the early work of \textsc{Greenberg} and 
\textsc{Witten}, \textsc{Smith} and 
\textsc{Mosier} \cite{smith_mosier} were already suggesting in 1986 
\enquote{where some 
data items are used more frequently than others, consider grouping those items 
at the top of the display}. Their solution was articulated in 3 steps : (1) 
maintaining the standard selection mechanism, (2) eliminating the need for 
users to remember additional commands and (3) reorganizing menu items based on 
usage frequency such that the most frequently selected items are moved to the 
top of the menu. 
The founding notions of split menu were finally set.\newline

\textsc{Sears} and \textsc{Shneiderman} defined a split menu as a menu created 
by splitting a menu 
into two sections such as frequently selected items are placed in the top 
section and infrequently selected items are placed in the bottom section. Such 
a 
menu organization proves useful \textit{if and only if} a small subset of the 
menu items represent the majority of selections. This menu organization is 
illustrated by Figure \ref{fig:sears_split} with a dark gray top section above 
the usual alphabetically ordered menu. Notice that most frequently 
selected items are moved to the top section and do not appear anymore in the 
remaining alphabetically ordered menu. Both authors defined a set of 
preliminary guidelines based on initial observations about user's selections 
and refined them into a cognitive model. These guidelines are still applicable 
nowadays and will be explained later in the report considering their 
importance. 
The cognitive model allowed both researchers to prove that (1) a linear model 
could be applied to the infrequently selected items and (2) a logarithmic model 
called \textit{Fitts’ Law} could be applied to the most frequently selected 
items. The linear model illustrates the fact that users spend most of their 
time 
searching an unfamiliar item in a linear fashion by scrolling down the 
given menu. The logarithmic approach proves that users do not scan the entire 
menu when searching for a familiar item but use the order of the menu instead. 
For example, a subject will start at the middle of the menu and will then 
decide 
if the desired item should be above or below this position.\newline

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \include{tikz/sears_split}
    \label{fig:sears_split}
\end{figure}

Split menu provided the missing concept to conciliate both user performance and 
user preference. Indeed \textsc{Sears} and \textsc{Shneiderman} conducted two 
in situ usability 
studies and managed to prove interesting properties : (1) split menu allows to 
enhance user performance only after a short period of one week adjustment, (2) 
split menu allows 17-58\% time savings, (3) 9 out of 13 users expressed 
preference for split menu, (4) 3 out of 13 users expressed no preference and 
(4) 
split menu provides benefits of both frequency ordered and alphabetically 
ordered menus. In conclusion, \textsc{Sears} and \textsc{Shneiderman} proved 
that frequency 
reordering was not sufficient alone. To become efficient, such a menu has to be 
combined with a traditional alphabetical menu and must display the most 
frequently selected items as a \textit{hot list} at the top of this 
alphabetical menu.

\section{Adaptive vs. Adaptable approach}

During the 2000’s, two antagonist notions - respectively called 
\textit{adaptive} and \textit{adaptable} menus - were also prone to discussions 
and researches. Some findings are unclear and highly nuanced but they are still 
worth investigating.\newline

Khalid Al-Omar and Dimitrios Rigas \cite{alomar1} defined the 
concept of \textit{adaptive menu} as \enquote{a system-controlled menu that 
dynamically changes the interface layout and content to each user’s needs}. 
These menus tend to use \textit{graphical} or \textit{spatial techniques} to 
reduce visual search time. A \textit{spatial technique} consists of 
recognizing the most interesting items and copying/moving them for easier 
access. Split menus are based on this notion such that the 
most frequently selected items are moved to the top of the menu. A 
\textit{graphical technique} consists of recognizing the most interesting items 
and then modifying their graphical representation. For example, the most 
frequently selected items could be boldfaced to become catchy for the eyes. 
Both authors defined the concept of \textit{adaptable menu} as \enquote{a 
user-controlled menu that provides techniques which permit the users to adjust 
their layout and content to suit their needs}. Some adaptable menus are said to 
be \textit{coarse-grained} and allow users to move interesting items up or down 
the menu. Others are said to be \textit{fine-grained} and allow users to move 
directly these interesting items to a specific position in the menu. Khalid 
Al-Omar and Dimitrios Rigas finally insisted on a third notion called 
\textit{mixed-initiative} which has the ability to combine both adaptable and 
adaptive approaches at the same time. For example, by providing a menu that 
either displays the most frequent or the most recent items in the top section 
and such that this criteria is chosen by the user itself. This type of menu 
can be considered as adaptable and adaptive at the same time because it is 
customized by the system according to the user’s choice. Adaptable, 
adaptive and mixed-initiative menu organizations are depicted by Figure 
\ref{fig:adapt_organizations}.\newline

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \include{tikz/adapt_organizations}
    \label{fig:adapt_organizations}
\end{figure}

Many studies were performed before the work of Khalid Al-Omar and Dimitrios 
Rigas. A first controlled lab study compared user performance between a static, 
an adaptive and an adaptable split menu. The 
findings were the following : (1) 55\% of the 27 subjects preferred the 
adaptable menu over the adaptive and static ones, (2) the static and adaptable 
split menus were equally performant but allowed a faster selection time than 
the 
adaptive one. A second study involved the traditional Microsoft Word font menu, 
and an adaptable and an adaptive versions of this menu. The experiment proved 
that (1) 65\% of the subjects preferred the adaptable menu, (2) 20\% preferred 
the default font menu and (3) 15\% preferred the adaptive menu. However it is 
important to put these conclusions into perspective because (1) both adaptable 
and adaptive interfaces were very different from the traditional font menu and 
(2) all participants used the adaptable interface before the adaptive approach 
such that they were already used to their own customization choices. A third 
study proved that (1) the adaptable approach was the most performant one, (2) 
adaptive and static split menu were equally performant, (3) 55\% of subjects 
preferred the adaptable approach \textit{if and only if} they received guidance 
to use it efficiently, (4) 30\% of subjects preferred the adaptive alternative 
and (5) 15\% preferred the traditional split menu. In conclusion, the adaptable 
approach seems to be the most preferred and the most performant alternative. 
However the results vary a lot from one study to another in terms of adaptive 
and static menus. Guidance also seems to be an interesting prerequisite to 
enhance user performance and user experience.\newline

Another set of studies restrained their focus on adaptive and static split 
menus. The first study required to perform a set of telephone directory 
searches. The authors proved that the adaptive menu reduced the selection time 
by 35\% and the error rate by 40\% in comparison to the static menu. Moreover 
the adaptive menu was preferred by 69\% of the participants. A second study 
presented different results. Indeed the traditional static approach was 
providing better time performance than the new adaptive one for the first group 
of tasks. It’s only during the second part of the experiment that both menus 
were considered equally performant. In this case it is interesting to point out 
that users preferred the static approach to the adaptive one. In conclusion, it 
seems that the adaptive approach still needs a few tweaks in order to prove a 
concrete usefulness. Notice that both a period of adjustment and guidance 
seem essential for users to become performant with new types of menu 
organization.\newline

In 2005, Teophanis Tsandilas \cite{tsandilas} managed to explain why the 
adaptive approach was often disliked by users. He conducted an experiment based 
on 2 different adaptation techniques respectively called \textit{highlighting 
suggestions} and \textit{shrinking non-suggested items}. The first technique 
consisted of highlighting 4 to 8 suggested items based on the user’s cursor 
position. The second one consisted of highlighting 4 to 8 suggested items while 
shrinking the undesired items with a fisheye lens method. Both menu 
organizations are depicted by figure \ref{fig:tsandilas_menus} which 
highlights items A, B, F and H as suggested items. Teophanis Tsandilas proved 
that the effectiveness of adaptive techniques may vary along with the accuracy 
of their prediction mechanism. Indeed a low prediction accuracy lead the users 
to untrust the system. And of course user performance vary a lot according to 
this level of accuracy. In conclusion, Teophanis Tsandilas explained that 
adaptive mechanisms had to be carefully implemented and tested to 
prove efficient enough.\newline

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \include{tikz/tsandilas_menus}
    \label{fig:tsandilas_menus}
\end{figure}

In 2010, Khalid Al-Omar and Dimitrios Rigas went even further. They conducted 
an experiment based on 5 distinct menu organizations : (1) adaptable menu, (2) 
adaptive split menu, (3) adaptive/adaptable highlighted menu, (3) 
adaptive/adaptable minimised menu and (4) mixed-initiative menu. These new menu 
organizations are depicted by Figure \ref{fig:khalid_menus}. It is interesting 
to notice that the adaptive split menu was divided into 2 top sections. They 
were respectively dedicated to frequency and recency ordering. Each 
organization was respectively tested with a large menu of 29 items and with a 
small menu of 17 items. Both authors found out that user satisfaction was 
affected by the size of the menu. In overall the adaptive/adaptable minimised 
menu was the most preferred approach for the small menu, followed by the 
adaptable and adaptive/adaptable highlighted menus. The worst alternatives were 
the mixed-initiative approach and the adaptive split menu. However the 
mixed-initiative approach was by far the most preferred one for the large menu, 
followed by the adaptive/adaptable minimised interface. Adaptive split menu, 
adaptable and adaptive/adaptable highlighted menus were mostly disliked by the 
participants for the large menu. Therefore Khalid Al-Omar and Dimitrios Rigas 
concluded that the size of personalised content was a matter of concern for 
user satisfaction : (1) users preferred to have less control and receive more 
help from the system for large menus, (2) users preferred when desired items 
were moved to the top section and undesired ones were hidden from the menu and 
(3) the concept of split menu was less efficient for small menus. In other 
words, users prefer adaptable interfaces for small menus because they are more 
likely to customize a small menu than a large one. Indeed a large content 
requires more effort to be understood and used efficiently. Users also liked 
the 
idea of minimising the menu and reducing the number of displayed items. Finally 
both authors made an interesting observation : the recency criteria was not 
used 
by the test participants. Using such a criteria implies to update the menu each 
time a selection is performed. Therefore the menu is constantly being modified 
and it becomes confusing for users.\newline

\section{Responsive menus}
In 2009, Yusuke Fukazawa et al. \cite{fukazawa} focused their researches on 
menus for mobile phones, observing an increasing complexity in mobile 
interfaces. They conducted an experiment that last 6 days with 20 participants. 
Each subject was given an additional Windows mobile phone configured with 3 
distinct menu organizations described as \textit{responsive}. A responsive menu 
is designed with the idea that mobile screens are smaller than desktop 
computers and that menus should therefore be adapted to this constraint. The 
first one was made of 2-column items and was displaying the most important 
items 
at the top. The last two menus were displaying varying item sizes : the more 
important the item was, the bigger it was displayed. Yusuke Fukazawa et al. 
observed that 70\% of the participants were both satisfied by the new menu 
organizations and by the prediction function used to identify important items. 
However they noticed that \textit{master users} were showing higher preferences 
for old menus and \textit{novice users} were more satisfied by new menu 
organizations.\newline

\section{Learning outcomes}
Lots of interesting findings have been highlighted by these previous 
researches. 
First, \textsc{Card} proved that a \textit{meaningful organization} of menu 
items such 
as alphabetical or categorical ordering was beneficial for user experience. 
\textsc{Somberg} later proved that \textit{positionally constant} menus were 
preferred 
by users such that items should not move too much within the menu. He also 
identified that a \textit{period of adjustment} was required to handle 
efficiently new menu organizations. Then \textsc{Sears} and \textsc{Shneiderman} 
managed to find 
the right balance between dynamic and static menus by introducing the concept 
of 
\textit{split menu}. It is a great example that combines almost positionally 
constant menu, frequency-ordering and meaningful organization. Experiments 
conducted before Khalid Al-Omar and Dimitrios Rigas proved that 
\textit{adaptable approach} was the most preferred alternative. They also 
proved that both a \textit{period of adjustment} and \textit{guidance} were 
necessary prerequisites for users to understand new menu organizations. 
Teophanis Tsandilas later explained that the \textit{accuracy prediction} of 
the adaptive mechanism was critical for the adaptive approach to be performant. 
Finally Khalid Al-Omar and Dimitrios Rigas proved that users were showing 
preferences for their \textit{minimised menu} because it was hiding unwanted 
items and therefore displaying less items at the same time. They also proved 
that split menu was less efficient for small menus and highlighted the fact 
that alternatives may be required for small screens. Yusuke Fukazawa et al. 
investigated this possibility and implemented \textit{responsive} menus. They 
identified varying reactions between \textit{master} and \textit{novice users}. 
Indeed master users like to have more control and novice users prefer to be 
helped by the system. Master users also showed preferences for traditional menus 
because they were already use to them.
