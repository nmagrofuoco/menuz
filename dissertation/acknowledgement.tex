\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

This Master's thesis is the accomplishment of many years of ongoing learning. 
It represents my contribution to this magnificent field of study which is 
human-computer interaction.\\

I would first like to thank sincerely my thesis advisor Prof. Jean
\textsc{Vanderdonckt}. His door was always open whenever I ran into an issue 
or had a question about my research or experiment. He steered me in the 
right direction from our first meeting until the very last one. Even though he 
was travelling or on vacation, he was always careful about my doubts and 
questions.\\

I would also like to acknowledge the participants of the experiment. They 
graciously agreed to take part to this thesis by giving their free time to 
computer science.\\

Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents for 
providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my 
own process of learning, studying, researching, coding and writing this 
thesis. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. Thank 
you.\\
